Rumah tani application or abbreviated as RUTA is an innovative agricultural e-commerce application designed to address the challenges faced by Indonesian farmers, such as limited access to modern technology, information, and fair market opportunities. By facilitating direct transactions between farmers and consumers, RUTA eliminates middlemen, improves market access, and encourages sustainable agricultural practices. The app not only empowers farmers with up-to-date agricultural knowledge and efficient online transactions, but also significantly improves their income stability and economic well-being. In addition, RUTA contributes to broader digital inclusion in rural areas, creating a more transparent, efficient, and sustainable agricultural ecosystem, ultimately providing long-term benefits to all stakeholders, including farmers, consumers, businesses, and government agencies.
